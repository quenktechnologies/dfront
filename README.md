# Culvert

Toolkit for making data management application.

## Introduction

This is a toolkit based on [@quenk/jouvert][1] used in Quenk projects to build
single page UIs for information management systems. These APIs are even more
opinionated than the jouvert ones and are more or less designed around building
only specific kinds of apps.

These APIs are designed to be the frontend for the dback modules.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @quenk/dfront
```
