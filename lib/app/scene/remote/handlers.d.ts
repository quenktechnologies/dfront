/**
 * This module provides common handlers used in QT projects for fetching and
 * displaying data. Data management apps tend to have many different screens
 * that function similarly but focus on a specific kind of data item each.
 *
 * To enjoy re-usability between these screens, loading of data is usually done
 * via [[RemoteModel]] instances in combination with [[CompleteHandler]]s. This
 * way, common behaviours can be shared by simply using an instance of the
 * CompleteHandler class with the desired effect.
 *
 * As much as possible, the CompleteHandlers here try to do one thing only so
 * that they are more composable. This should allow multiple handlers to be
 * combined into one in arrangements that suit the apps needs.
