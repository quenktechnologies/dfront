 * 1. Provide a view to the director when spawned.
 * 2. Intercept form messages via the FormListener interface.
 * 3. Construct remote data models via a RemoteModelFactory.
 * 4. Show a view without a route dispatch.
 * 5. Provide a hook for doing actions after the view has been shown.
 * 6. Provide a method for reloading the interaction.
 *
 * This class was originally part of the cis project which was influenced by
